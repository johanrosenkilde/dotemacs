# johanrosenkilde's Emacs configuration

Beware that I don't regularly purge my configurations for file types I don't use
anymore. A configuration file that has not been updated for a long time probably
reflects that I do not use that particular config anymore, so the setup should
be treated with extreme scepticism.
